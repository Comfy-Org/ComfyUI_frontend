      **If workspace needs payment method:**
      - Creates scheduled subscription (status=scheduled)
      - Returns status="needs_payment_method" with payment_method_url
      - After payment method is added via checkout, subscription is finalized

      For existing subscriptions, this performs a plan change (upgrade/downgrade).

      3. Clears the ending_before on the Metronome recurring commit

      Can only be called while the subscription is still in the cancellation grace period
      (before the period ends). After period end, you must subscribe again.
