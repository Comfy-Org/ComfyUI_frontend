            const comment = `## ⚠️ OSS Compliance Check Failed

            The OSS build verification has failed. This usually means:

            **Possible Issues:**
            1. ✗ Proprietary font files (ABCROM) detected in build output
            2. ✗ Telemetry code (Mixpanel) detected in OSS build
            3. ✗ Non-compliant dependency licenses detected

            **What to do:**
            1. Review the [workflow logs](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}) for details
            2. Check the uploaded build artifacts for inspection
            3. Ensure tree-shaking is working correctly for cloud-specific code
            4. See [OSS Compliance docs](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}/docs/OSS_COMPLIANCE.md) for guidance

            **Build artifacts** have been uploaded for 7 days for your inspection.
