# CRDT / multiplayer invariants

This is the machine-addressable review log for the package. IDs are stable; do not renumber or silently weaken them.

## Three roles

- **Transport**: how bytes move (WebSocket / Redis PubSub / WebRTC). Cheap and swappable; P2P is a transport choice.
- **Merge authority**: the process that runs the applier/conflict resolution and whose result is canonical when edits race. Hard to change.
- **Persistence**: who writes snapshots to the DB. It may differ from merge authority; “SSOT in the DB” is a persistence statement, not an authority statement.

## KEEP-ALIVE

### KA-1 — Ops are the replication unit end-to-end
**Rule:** Between any two replicas that edited independently, exchange semantic ops, never raw Yjs updates.  
**Why:** Convergence holds iff independently edited replicas exchange ops.  
**Enforced by:** Reviewer profiles [`convergence-idempotency`](../.agents/checks/convergence-idempotency.md) and [`follower-boundary`](../.agents/checks/follower-boundary.md); architecture decision [ADR-002](decisions/ADR-002-ops-replication-unit.md).

### KA-2 — The ordering/identity key rides inside the op
**Rule:** `[base_version, actor, op_id]` is a total order any replica can evaluate offline; `op_id` is uuid4 hex minted by the creator before dispatch and never regenerated.  
**Why:** `op_id` is both the dedupe identity and final LWW outcome tiebreak.  
**Enforced by:** `test/lww.test.ts`, `test/stamp-target-identity.test.ts`, and [`op-identity`](../.agents/checks/op-identity.md).

### KA-3 — The op layer stays pure & portable
**Rule:** Applier, projection, and mint have zero DOM/framework/LiteGraph/server-only dependencies and run identically in browser and host; assert `yjs`-only directly, not merely by denylist.  
**Why:** A peer, edge, browser, and Node host must execute one implementation identically.  
**Enforced by:** `scripts/check-purity.mjs` (package level), `scripts/check-import-graph.mjs` + `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` rule `src-runtime-dep-is-yjs-only` (module-graph level, per source module), `test/purity.test.ts`, `test/parity.test.ts`, and [`purity`](../.agents/checks/purity.md). Cross-language implementations must pass the canonical golden vectors in `fixtures/golden-vectors/`.

### KA-4 — The applier is deterministic and idempotent
**Rule:** Same op-set + causal order gives the same projection; duplicate `op_id` is a true no-op with byte-identical `encodeStateAsUpdate`.  
**Why:** Retries and different legal arrival orders must not diverge replicas.  
**Enforced by:** `test/convergence.test.ts`, `test/connect-lww.test.ts`, `test/applier.test.ts`, and [`convergence-idempotency`](../.agents/checks/convergence-idempotency.md). Property coverage is tracked in #24.

### KA-5 — IDs are collision-free without coordination
**Rule:** Use 53-bit random mint; document high-water marks are advisory, never allocators; FE stable IDs must be non-colliding strings.  
**Why:** Offline peers must create entities without a central allocator.  
**Enforced by:** **UNGUARDED — see roadmap**.

### KA-6 — Raw struct updates flow host → follower one-way only
**Rule:** Followers never write the shared doc.  
**Why:** Reverse-flow Yjs structs from independently edited docs can corrupt or diverge state.  
**Enforced by:** [`follower-boundary`](../.agents/checks/follower-boundary.md) and [ADR-002](decisions/ADR-002-ops-replication-unit.md); runtime boundary enforcement is outside this package.

### KA-7 — Presence/awareness is ephemeral
**Rule:** Cursors, selection, and hover use the awareness channel and are never persisted into the doc.  
**Why:** Ephemeral UI state must not pollute semantic history or snapshots.  
**Enforced by:** [`follower-boundary`](../.agents/checks/follower-boundary.md); runtime channel enforcement is outside this package.

### KA-8 — Layout/view state is a separate FE-owned Y.Doc
**Rule:** `pos`, pan/zoom, live drags, and groups do not go in the shared semantic doc; state the split and reconciliation rule explicitly.  
**Why:** High-frequency presentation state has different ownership and merge semantics.  
**Enforced by:** **UNGUARDED — see roadmap; frontend-owned boundary**.

### KA-9 — Optimistic overlay is presentation-only
**Rule:** Pending local ops live on a shadow, clear on effect not ack, are never encoded as a Yjs update, and never merge into the shared doc.  
**Why:** Speculative UI state must not become canonical replication state.  
**Enforced by:** [`follower-boundary`](../.agents/checks/follower-boundary.md); runtime overlay enforcement is outside this package.

### KA-10 — Bootstrap/reconnect forks from ONE seeded snapshot
**Rule:** Use `applyUpdate` of a common snapshot; never independently re-seed the same base.  
**Why:** Independent Yjs struct identities can diverge despite identical JSON bases.  
**Enforced by:** `test/convergence.test.ts`, `test/lww.test.ts`, and `test/connect-lww.test.ts`.

### KA-11 — Schema-version discipline is enforced on read
**Rule:** Bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` when an old reader would mis-project a new doc; fail closed on unreadable schema and provide a `migrate()` path.  
**Why:** Readers must not silently mis-project an incompatible document.  
**Enforced by:** `test/roundtrip.test.ts`; normal read-path coverage is **UNGUARDED — see roadmap issue #24**.

### KA-12 — Catalog pinned at mint
**Rule:** `meta.catalog_version` cites the catalog by SHA, not branch; reject widget writes to uncatalogued classes loudly.  
**Why:** Replay semantics must not drift with a moving vocabulary.  
**Enforced by:** `test/roundtrip.test.ts`, [`catalog-pinning`](../.agents/checks/catalog-pinning.md), and [ADR-003](decisions/ADR-003-catalog-sha-at-mint.md). Branch-pin lint is **UNGUARDED — see roadmap**.

## FORECLOSE

### FC-1 — Never exchange raw Yjs struct updates between independently edited docs
**Why:** This is the length-8 KSampler corruption path.  
**Enforced by:** [`follower-boundary`](../.agents/checks/follower-boundary.md) and [ADR-002](decisions/ADR-002-ops-replication-unit.md).

### FC-2 — Never make the server the only thing that can assign order
**Rule:** Server sequence must not be the sole conflict resolver beyond merely advancing `base_version`.  
**Why:** Sole server ordering kills hostless P2P ordering.  
**Enforced by:** `test/lww.test.ts` and [`op-identity`](../.agents/checks/op-identity.md).

### FC-3 — Never couple the applier/op layer to server-only or DOM/framework-only dependencies
**Why:** Such coupling prevents execution at a peer, edge, or browser and invites a second implementation.  
**Enforced by:** `scripts/check-purity.mjs`, `scripts/check-import-graph.mjs` + `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` rule `src-no-node-builtins`, `test/purity.test.ts`, [`purity`](../.agents/checks/purity.md), and [ADR-001](decisions/ADR-001-single-shared-applier.md).

### FC-4 — Never use full-document replace as the mutation primitive
**Why:** It increases ingress/egress, clobbers concurrent edits, and kills op-log replay and observability.  
**Enforced by:** [`convergence-idempotency`](../.agents/checks/convergence-idempotency.md); integration enforcement is outside this package.

### FC-5 — Never let a follower write the shared doc or merge an optimistic overlay back in
**Why:** Either path introduces an unauthorized independently edited update stream.  
**Enforced by:** [`follower-boundary`](../.agents/checks/follower-boundary.md).

### FC-6 — Never persist presence or put layout/view state in the shared semantic doc
**Why:** Ephemeral and presentation state do not belong to semantic replication.  
**Enforced by:** [`follower-boundary`](../.agents/checks/follower-boundary.md); runtime boundaries are outside this package.

### FC-7 — Never regenerate `op_id` on retry or resolve conflicts by client-id instead of stamp
**Why:** This poisons dedupe and future LWW gating.  
**Enforced by:** `test/lww.test.ts`, `test/applier.test.ts`, and [`op-identity`](../.agents/checks/op-identity.md).

### FC-8 — Never re-derive `add_node` payloads from a schema on replay
**Rule:** Copy payloads verbatim; defaults drift.  
**Why:** Replaying the same op against a changed schema must not change its meaning.  
**Enforced by:** `test/replay.test.ts` and `test/roundtrip.test.ts`.

### FC-9 — Do not permanently lock `base_version` to a server-assigned monotonic counter only
**Rule:** A scalar without causality is acceptable for V1 convergence, but leave room for a logical clock.  
**Why:** A permanent scalar ceiling prevents high-quality offline merge.  
**Enforced by:** [`op-identity`](../.agents/checks/op-identity.md); logical-clock evolution is **UNGUARDED — see roadmap**.

### FC-10 — Never cite the frozen vocabulary/catalog by moving branch instead of SHA
**Why:** A moving reference causes silent contract drift.  
**Enforced by:** [`catalog-pinning`](../.agents/checks/catalog-pinning.md) and [ADR-003](decisions/ADR-003-catalog-sha-at-mint.md). Automated lint is **UNGUARDED — see roadmap**.
