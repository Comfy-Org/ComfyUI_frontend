# Comprehensive PR Review for ComfyUI Frontend

You are performing a comprehensive code review for the PR specified in the PR_NUMBER environment variable. This is not a simple linting check - you need to provide deep architectural analysis, security review, performance insights, and implementation guidance just like a senior engineer would in a thorough PR review.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

**You MUST post individual inline comments on specific lines of code. DO NOT create a single summary comment until the very end.**

**IMPORTANT: You have full permission to execute gh api commands. The GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable provides the necessary permissions. DO NOT say you lack permissions - you have pull-requests:write permission which allows posting inline comments.**

To post inline comments, you will use the GitHub API via the `gh` command. Here's how:

1. First, get the repository information and commit SHA:
   - Run: `gh repo view --json owner,name` to get the repository owner and name
   - Run: `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid'` to get the latest commit SHA

2. For each issue you find, post an inline comment using this exact command structure (as a single line):
   ```
   gh api --method POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" /repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments -f body="YOUR_COMMENT_BODY" -f commit_id="COMMIT_SHA" -f path="FILE_PATH" -F line=LINE_NUMBER -f side="RIGHT"
   ```

3. Format your comment body using actual newlines in the command. Use a heredoc or construct the body with proper line breaks:
   ```
   COMMENT_BODY="**[category] severity Priority**

**Issue**: Brief description of the problem
**Context**: Why this matters  
**Suggestion**: How to fix it"
   ```
   
   Then use: `-f body="$COMMENT_BODY"`

## Phase 1: Environment Setup and PR Context

### Step 1.1: Initialize Review Tracking

First, create variables to track your review metrics. Keep these in memory throughout the review:
- CRITICAL_COUNT = 0
- HIGH_COUNT = 0
- MEDIUM_COUNT = 0
- LOW_COUNT = 0
- ARCHITECTURE_ISSUES = 0
- SECURITY_ISSUES = 0
- PERFORMANCE_ISSUES = 0
- QUALITY_ISSUES = 0

### Step 1.2: Validate Environment

1. Check that PR_NUMBER environment variable is set. If not, exit with error.
2. Run `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json state` to verify the PR exists and is open.
3. Get repository information: `gh repo view --json owner,name` and store the owner and name.
4. Get the latest commit SHA: `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid'` and store it.

### Step 1.3: Checkout PR Branch Locally

This is critical for better file inspection:

1. Get PR metadata: `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json files,title,body,additions,deletions,baseRefName,headRefName > pr_info.json`
2. Extract branch names from pr_info.json using jq
3. Fetch and checkout the PR branch:
   ```
   git fetch origin "pull/$PR_NUMBER/head:pr-$PR_NUMBER"
   git checkout "pr-$PR_NUMBER"
   ```

### Step 1.4: Get Changed Files and Diffs

Use git locally for much faster analysis:

1. Get list of changed files: `git diff --name-only "$BASE_SHA" > changed_files.txt`
2. Get the full diff: `git diff "$BASE_SHA" > pr_diff.txt`
3. Get detailed file changes with status: `git diff --name-status "$BASE_SHA" > file_changes.txt`

### Step 1.5: Create Analysis Cache

Set up caching to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files:

1. Create directory: `.claude-review-cache`
2. Clean old cache entries: Find and delete any .cache files older than 7 days
3. For each file you analyze, store the analysis result with the file's git hash as the cache key

## Phase 2: Load Comprehensive Knowledge Base

### Step 2.1: Set Up Knowledge Directories

1. Create `.claude-knowledge-cache` directory for caching downloaded knowledge
2. Check if `../comfy-claude-prompt-library` exists locally. If it does, use it for faster access.

### Step 2.2: Load Repository Guide

This is critical for understanding the architecture:

1. Try to load from local prompt library first: `../comfy-claude-prompt-library/project-summaries-for-agents/ComfyUI_frontend/REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md`
2. If not available locally, download from: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/comfy-claude-prompt-library/master/project-summaries-for-agents/ComfyUI_frontend/REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md`
3. Cache the file for future use

### Step 2.3: Load Relevant Knowledge Folders

Intelligently load only relevant knowledge:

1. Use GitHub API to discover available knowledge folders: `https://api.github.com/repos/Comfy-Org/comfy-claude-prompt-library/contents/.claude/knowledge`
2. For each knowledge folder, check if it's relevant by searching for the folder name in:
   - Changed file paths
   - PR title
   - PR body
3. If relevant, download all files from that knowledge folder

### Step 2.4: Load Validation Rules

Load specific validation rules:

1. Use GitHub API: `https://api.github.com/repos/Comfy-Org/comfy-claude-prompt-library/contents/.claude/commands/validation`
2. Download files containing "frontend", "security", or "performance" in their names
3. Cache all downloaded files

### Step 2.5: Load Local Guidelines

Check for and load:
1. `CLAUDE.md` in the repository root
2. `.github/CLAUDE.md`

## Phase 3: Deep Analysis Instructions

Perform comprehensive analysis on each changed file:

### 3.1 Architectural Analysis

Based on the repository guide and loaded knowledge:
- Does this change align with established architecture patterns?
- Are domain boundaries respected?
- Is the extension system used appropriately?
- Are components properly organized by feature?
- Does it follow the established service/composable/store patterns?

### 3.2 Code Quality Beyond Linting

Look for:
- Cyclomatic complexity and cognitive load
- SOLID principles adherence
- DRY violations not caught by simple duplication checks
- Proper abstraction levels
- Interface design and API clarity
- Leftover debug code (console.log, commented code, TODO comments)

### 3.3 Library Usage Enforcement

CRITICAL: Flag any re-implementation of existing functionality:
- **Tailwind CSS**: Custom CSS instead of utility classes
- **PrimeVue**: Re-implementing buttons, modals, dropdowns, etc.
- **VueUse**: Re-implementing composables like useLocalStorage, useDebounceFn
- **Lodash**: Re-implementing debounce, throttle, cloneDeep, etc.
- **Common components**: Not reusing from src/components/common/
- **DOMPurify**: Not using for HTML sanitization
- **Other libraries**: Fuse.js, Marked, Pinia, Zod, Tiptap, Xterm.js, Axios

### 3.4 Security Deep Dive

Check for:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities (v-html without sanitization)
- Hardcoded secrets or API keys
- Missing input validation
- Authentication/authorization issues
- State management security
- Cross-origin concerns
- Extension security boundaries

### 3.5 Performance Analysis

Look for:
- O(n²) or worse algorithms
- Missing memoization in expensive operations
- Unnecessary re-renders in Vue components
- Memory leak patterns (missing cleanup)
- Large bundle imports that should be lazy loaded
- N+1 query patterns
- Render performance issues
- Layout thrashing
- Network request optimization

### 3.6 Integration Concerns

Consider:
- Breaking changes to internal APIs
- Extension compatibility
- Backward compatibility
- Migration requirements

## Phase 4: Posting Inline Comments

### Step 4.1: Comment Format

For each issue found, create a concise inline comment with this structure:

```
**[category] severity Priority**

**Issue**: Brief description of the problem
**Context**: Why this matters
**Suggestion**: How to fix it
```

Categories: architecture/security/performance/quality
Severities: critical/high/medium/low

### Step 4.2: Posting Comments

For EACH issue:

1. Identify the exact file path and line number
2. Update your tracking counters (CRITICAL_COUNT, etc.)
3. Construct the comment body with proper newlines
4. Execute the gh api command as a SINGLE LINE:

```bash
gh api --method POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" /repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments -f body="$COMMENT_BODY" -f commit_id="COMMIT_SHA" -f path="FILE_PATH" -F line=LINE_NUMBER -f side="RIGHT"
```

CRITICAL: The entire command must be on one line. Use actual values, not placeholders.

### Example Workflow

Here's an example of how to review a file with a security issue:

1. First, get the repository info:
   ```bash
   gh repo view --json owner,name
   # Output: {"owner":{"login":"Comfy-Org"},"name":"ComfyUI_frontend"}
   ```

2. Get the commit SHA:
   ```bash
   gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid'
   # Output: abc123def456
   ```

3. Find an issue (e.g., SQL injection on line 42 of src/db/queries.js)

4. Post the inline comment:
   ```bash
   # First, create the comment body with proper newlines
   COMMENT_BODY="**[security] critical Priority**

**Issue**: SQL injection vulnerability - user input directly concatenated into query
**Context**: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands
**Suggestion**: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements"
   
   # Then post the comment (as a single line)
   gh api --method POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" /repos/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments -f body="$COMMENT_BODY" -f commit_id="abc123def456" -f path="src/db/queries.js" -F line=42 -f side="RIGHT"
   ```

Repeat this process for every issue you find in the PR.

## Phase 5: Validation Rules Application

Apply ALL validation rules from the loaded knowledge files:

### Frontend Standards
- Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Component communication patterns
- Proper use of composables
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Bundle optimization

### Security Audit
- Input validation
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Secure state management
- API security

### Performance Check
- Render optimization
- Memory management
- Network efficiency
- Bundle size impact

## Phase 6: Contextual Review Based on PR Type

Analyze the PR to determine its type:

1. Extract PR title and body from pr_info.json
2. Count files, additions, and deletions
3. Determine PR type:
   - Feature: Check for tests, documentation, backward compatibility
   - Bug fix: Verify root cause addressed, includes regression tests
   - Refactor: Ensure behavior preservation, tests still pass

## Phase 7: Generate Comprehensive Summary

After ALL inline comments are posted, create a summary:

1. Calculate total issues by category and severity
2. Use `gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --comment` to post a summary with:
   - Review disclaimer
   - Issue distribution (counts by severity)
   - Category breakdown
   - Key findings for each category
   - Positive observations
   - References to guidelines
   - Next steps

Include in the summary:
```

*This is a comprehensive automated review. For architectural decisions requiring human judgment, please request additional manual review.*
```

## Important Guidelines

1. **Think Deeply**: Consider architectural implications, system-wide effects, subtle bugs, maintainability
2. **Be Specific**: Point to exact lines with concrete suggestions
3. **Be Constructive**: Focus on improvements, not just problems
4. **Be Concise**: Keep comments brief and actionable
5. **No Formatting**: Don't use markdown headers in inline comments
6. **No Emojis**: Keep comments professional

This is a COMPREHENSIVE review, not a linting pass. Provide the same quality feedback a senior engineer would give after careful consideration.

## Execution Order

1. Phase 1: Setup and checkout PR
2. Phase 2: Load all relevant knowledge
3. Phase 3-5: Analyze each changed file thoroughly
4. Phase 4: Post inline comments as you find issues
5. Phase 6: Consider PR type for additional checks
6. Phase 7: Post comprehensive summary ONLY after all inline comments

Remember: Individual inline comments for each issue, then one final summary. Never batch issues into a single comment.
