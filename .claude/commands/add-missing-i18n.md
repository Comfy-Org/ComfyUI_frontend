# Add Missing i18n Translations

## Task: Add English translations for all new localized strings

### Step 1: Identify new translation keys
Find all translation keys that were added in the current branch's changes. These keys appear as arguments to translation functions: `t()`, `st()`, `$t()`, or similar i18n functions.

### Step 2: Add translations to English locale file
For each new translation key found, add the corresponding English text to the file `src/locales/en/main.json`.

### Key-to-JSON mapping rules:
- Translation keys use dot notation to represent nested JSON structure
- Convert dot notation to nested JSON objects when adding to the locale file
- Example: The key `g.user.name` maps to:
  ```json
  {
    "g": {
      "user": {
        "name": "User Name"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Important notes:
1. **Only modify the English locale file** (`src/locales/en/main.json`)
2. **Do not modify other locale files** - translations for other languages are automatically generated by the `i18n.yaml` workflow
3. **Exception for manual translations**: Only add translations to non-English locale files if:
   - You have specific domain knowledge that would produce a more accurate translation than the automated system
   - The automated translation would likely be incorrect due to technical terminology or context-specific meaning

### Example workflow:
1. If you added `t('settings.advanced.enable')` in a Vue component
2. Add to `src/locales/en/main.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "settings": {
       "advanced": {
         "enable": "Enable advanced settings"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
