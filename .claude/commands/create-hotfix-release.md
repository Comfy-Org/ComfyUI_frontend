# Create Hotfix Release

This command creates patch/hotfix releases for ComfyUI Frontend by backporting fixes to stable core branches. It handles both automated backports (preferred) and manual cherry-picking (fallback).

**Process Overview:**
1. **Try automated backports first** (via labels) 
2. **Manual cherry-picking** if automation fails
3. **Create patch release** with version bump
4. **Publish GitHub release** (manually uncheck "latest")
5. **Update ComfyUI requirements.txt** via PR

<task>
Create a hotfix release by backporting commits/PRs from main to a core branch: $ARGUMENTS

Expected format: Comma-separated list of commits or PR numbers
Examples: 
- `#1234,#5678` (PRs - preferred)
- `abc123,def456` (commit hashes)
- `#1234,abc123` (mixed)

If no arguments provided, the command will guide you through identifying commits/PRs to backport.
</task>

## Prerequisites

- Push access to repository
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated  
- Clean working tree
- Understanding of what fixes need backporting

## Hotfix Release Process

### Step 1: Try Automated Backports First

**Check if automated backports were attempted:**

1. **For each PR, check existing backport labels:**
   ```bash
   gh pr view #1234 --json labels | jq -r '.labels[].name'
   ```

2. **If no backport labels exist, add them now:**
   ```bash
   # Add backport labels (this triggers automated backports)
   gh pr edit #1234 --add-label "needs-backport"
   gh pr edit #1234 --add-label "1.24"  # Replace with target version
   ```

3. **Monitor automated backport workflow:**
   ```bash
   # Check for new backport PRs created by automation
   gh pr list --author "github-actions" --label "backport" --limit 5
   ```

4. **If automated backports succeed:** 
   - Review and merge the automated backport PRs
   - Skip to Step 10 (Version Bump)
   
5. **If automated backports fail or have conflicts:** 
   - Continue to Step 2 for manual cherry-picking
   
6. **CONFIRMATION**: Are you proceeding because automated backports failed?

### Step 2: Identify Target Core Branch

1. Fetch the current ComfyUI requirements.txt from master branch:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/master/requirements.txt | grep "comfyui-frontend-package"
   ```
2. Extract the `comfyui-frontend-package` version (e.g., `comfyui-frontend-package==1.23.4`)
3. Parse version to get major.minor (e.g., `1.23.4` ‚Üí `1.23`)
4. Determine core branch: `core/<major>.<minor>` (e.g., `core/1.23`)
5. Verify the core branch exists: `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/core/*`
6. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Is `core/X.Y` the correct target branch?

### Step 3: Parse and Validate Arguments

1. Parse the comma-separated list of commits/PRs
2. For each item:
   - If starts with `#`: Treat as PR number
   - Otherwise: Treat as commit hash
3. For PR numbers:
   - Fetch PR details using `gh pr view <number>`
   - Extract the merge commit if PR is merged
   - If PR has multiple commits, list them all
   - **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Use merge commit or cherry-pick individual commits?
4. Validate all commit hashes exist in the repository

### Step 4: Analyze Target Changes

1. For each commit/PR to cherry-pick:
   - Display commit hash, author, date
   - Show PR title and number (if applicable)
   - Display commit message
   - Show files changed and diff statistics
   - Check if already in core branch: `git branch --contains <commit>`
2. Identify potential conflicts by checking changed files
3. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Proceed with these commits?

### Step 5: Create Hotfix Branch

1. Checkout the core branch (e.g., `core/1.23`)
2. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin core/X.Y`
3. Display current version from package.json
4. Create hotfix branch: `hotfix/<version>-<timestamp>`
   - Example: `hotfix/1.23.4-20241120`
5. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Created branch correctly?

### Step 6: Cherry-pick Changes

For each commit:
1. Attempt cherry-pick: `git cherry-pick <commit>`
2. If conflicts occur:
   - Display conflict details
   - Show conflicting sections
   - Provide resolution guidance
   - **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Conflicts resolved correctly?
3. After successful cherry-pick:
   - Show the changes: `git show HEAD`
   - Run validation: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint`
4. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Cherry-pick successful and valid?

### Step 7: Create PR to Core Branch

1. Push the hotfix branch: `git push origin hotfix/<version>-<timestamp>`
2. Create PR using gh CLI:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base core/X.Y --head hotfix/<version>-<timestamp> \
     --title "[Hotfix] Cherry-pick fixes to core/X.Y" \
     --body "Cherry-picked commits: ..."
   ```
3. Add appropriate labels (but NOT "Release" yet)
4. PR body should include:
   - List of cherry-picked commits/PRs
   - Original issue references
   - Testing instructions
   - Impact assessment
5. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: PR created correctly?

### Step 8: Wait for Tests

1. Monitor PR checks: `gh pr checks`
2. Display test results as they complete
3. If any tests fail:
   - Show failure details
   - Analyze if related to cherry-picks
   - **DECISION REQUIRED**: Fix and continue, or abort?
4. Wait for all required checks to pass
5. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: All tests passing?

### Step 9: Merge Hotfix PR

1. Verify all checks have passed
2. Check for required approvals
3. Merge the PR: `gh pr merge --merge`
4. Delete the hotfix branch
5. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: PR merged successfully?

### Step 10: Create Version Bump

1. Checkout the core branch: `git checkout core/X.Y`
2. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin core/X.Y`
3. Read current version from package.json
4. Determine patch version increment:
   - Current: `1.23.4` ‚Üí New: `1.23.5`
5. Create release branch named with new version: `release/1.23.5`
6. Update version in package.json to `1.23.5`
7. Commit: `git commit -m "[release] Bump version to 1.23.5"`
8. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Version bump correct?

### Step 11: Create Release PR

1. Push release branch: `git push origin release/1.23.5`
2. Create PR with Release label:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base core/X.Y --head release/1.23.5 \
     --title "[Release] v1.23.5" \
     --body "Release notes will be added shortly..." \
     --label "Release"
   ```
3. **CRITICAL**: Verify "Release" label is added
4. Create standardized release notes:
   ```bash
   cat > release-notes-${NEW_VERSION}.md << 'EOF'

   ```
   - For hotfixes, typically only populate the "Bug Fixes" section
   - Include links to the cherry-picked PRs/commits
   - Update the PR body with the release notes:
     ```bash
     gh pr edit ${PR_NUMBER} --body-file release-notes-${NEW_VERSION}.md
     ```
5. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Release PR has "Release" label?

### Step 12: Monitor Release Process

1. Wait for PR checks to pass
2. **FINAL CONFIRMATION**: Ready to trigger release by merging?
3. Merge the PR: `gh pr merge --merge`
4. Monitor release workflow:
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=release.yaml --limit=1
   gh run watch
   ```
5. Track progress:
   - GitHub release draft/publication
   - PyPI upload
   - pnpm types publication

### Step 13: Manually Publish Draft Release

**CRITICAL**: The release workflow creates a DRAFT release. You must manually publish it:

1. **Go to GitHub Releases:** https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/releases
2. **Find the DRAFT release** (e.g., "v1.23.5 Draft")
3. **Click "Edit release"**
4. **UNCHECK "Set as the latest release"** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
   - This prevents the hotfix from showing as "latest" 
   - Main branch should always be "latest release"
5. **Click "Publish release"**
6. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Draft release published with "latest" unchecked?

### Step 14: Create ComfyUI Requirements.txt Update PR

**IMPORTANT**: Create PR to update ComfyUI's requirements.txt:

1. **Create PR to `comfyanonymous/ComfyUI`** with this exact format:

**PR Title:** `Bump frontend to 1.23.5`

**PR Body:**
```markdown
Bump frontend to 1.23.5

```
python main.py --front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@1.23.5
```

- Diff: [Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend: v1.23.4...v1.23.5](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/compare/v1.23.4...v1.23.5)
- PyPI Package: https://pypi.org/project/comfyui-frontend-package/1.23.5/
- npm Types: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@comfyorg/comfyui-frontend-types/v/1.23.5

## Changes

- Fix: [Brief description of hotfixes included]
```

**Files changed:** Update `requirements.txt`:
```diff
- comfyui-frontend-package==1.23.4
+ comfyui-frontend-package==1.23.5
```

2. **Submit the PR and coordinate with ComfyUI maintainers**
3. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: ComfyUI requirements.txt PR created?

### Step 15: Post-Release Verification

1. Verify GitHub release:
   ```bash
   gh release view v1.23.5
   ```
2. Check PyPI package:
   ```bash
   pip index versions comfyui-frontend-package | grep 1.23.5
   ```
3. Verify npm package:
   ```bash
   pnpm view @comfyorg/comfyui-frontend-types@1.23.5
   ```
4. Monitor ComfyUI requirements.txt PR for approval/merge
5. Generate release summary with:
   - Version released
   - Commits included
   - Issues fixed
   - Distribution status
   - ComfyUI integration status
6. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Hotfix release fully completed?

## Safety Checks

Throughout the process:
- Always verify core branch matches ComfyUI's requirements.txt
- For PRs: Ensure using correct commits (merge vs individual)
- Check version numbers follow semantic versioning
- **Critical**: "Release" label must be on version bump PR
- Validate cherry-picks don't break core branch stability
- Keep audit trail of all operations

## Rollback Procedures

If something goes wrong:
- Before push: `git reset --hard origin/core/X.Y`
- After PR creation: Close PR and start over
- After failed release: Create new patch version with fixes
- Document any issues for future reference

## Important Notes

- **Always try automated backports first** - This command is for when automation fails
- Core branch version will be behind main - this is expected
- The "Release" label triggers the PyPI/npm publication
- **CRITICAL**: Always uncheck "Set as latest release" for hotfix releases
- **Must create ComfyUI requirements.txt PR** - Hotfix isn't complete without it
- PR numbers must include the `#` prefix
- Mixed commits/PRs are supported but review carefully
- Always wait for full test suite before proceeding

## Modern Workflow Context

**Primary Backport Method:** Automated via `needs-backport` + `X.YY` labels
**This Command Usage:** Fallback when automated backports fail/have conflicts
**Complete Hotfix:** Includes ComfyUI requirements.txt integration


This process ensures a complete hotfix release with proper GitHub publishing, ComfyUI integration, and multiple safety checkpoints.
