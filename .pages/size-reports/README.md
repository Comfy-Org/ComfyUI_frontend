# Bundle Size Reports

This directory is the output target for the Rollup visualizer report generated during `pnpm build`. The report file is emitted as `index.html`, and it can be published from the `.pages` directory if you want to surface the bundle analysis (for example on GitHub Pages).

Files in this directory are generated; regenerate them by re-running the production build.
