# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the ComfyUI Frontend project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help future developers understand why certain decisions were made and provide a historical record of the project's evolution.
