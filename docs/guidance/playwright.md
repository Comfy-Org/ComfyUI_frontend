# Playwright E2E Test Conventions

See `docs/testing/*.md` for detailed patterns.

## Best Practices

- Follow [Playwright Best Practices](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices)
- Do NOT use `waitForTimeout` - use Locator actions and retrying assertions
- Prefer specific selectors (role, label, test-id)
- Test across viewports

## Test Tags

Tags are respected by config:

- `@mobile` - Mobile viewport tests
- `@2x` - High DPI tests

## Test Data

- Check `browser_tests/assets/` for test data and fixtures
- Use realistic ComfyUI workflows for E2E tests

## Running Tests

```bash
pnpm test:browser                 # Run all E2E tests
pnpm test:browser -- --ui         # Interactive UI mode
```
