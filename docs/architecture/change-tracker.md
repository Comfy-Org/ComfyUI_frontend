# Change Tracker (Undo/Redo System)

The `ChangeTracker` class (`src/scripts/changeTracker.ts`) manages undo/redo
history by comparing serialized graph snapshots.

## How It Works

`captureCanvasState()` is the core method. It:

1. Serializes the current graph via `app.rootGraph.serialize()`
2. Deep-compares the result against the last known `activeState`
3. If different, pushes `activeState` onto `undoQueue` and replaces it

**It is not reactive.** Changes to the graph (widget values, node positions,
links, etc.) are only captured when `captureCanvasState()` is explicitly triggered.

**INVARIANT:** `captureCanvasState()` asserts that it is called on the active
workflow's tracker. Calling it on an inactive tracker logs an error in DEV and
returns early, preventing cross-workflow data corruption.

## Automatic Triggers

These are set up once in `ChangeTracker.init()`:

| Trigger                             | Event / Hook                                       | What It Catches                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Keyboard (non-modifier, non-repeat) | `window` `keydown`                                 | Shortcuts, typing in canvas                         |
| Modifier key release                | `window` `keyup`                                   | Releasing Ctrl/Shift/Alt/Meta                       |
| Mouse click                         | `window` `mouseup`                                 | General clicks on native DOM                        |
| Canvas mouse up                     | `LGraphCanvas.processMouseUp` override             | LiteGraph canvas interactions                       |
| Number/string dialog                | `LGraphCanvas.prompt` override                     | Dialog popups for editing widgets                   |
| Context menu close                  | `LiteGraph.ContextMenu.close` override             | COMBO widget menus in LiteGraph                     |
| Active input element                | `bindInput` (change/input/blur on focused element) | Native HTML input edits                             |
| Prompt queued                       | `api` `promptQueued` event                         | Dynamic widget changes on queue                     |
| Graph cleared                       | `api` `graphCleared` event                         | Full graph clear                                    |
| Transaction end                     | `litegraph:canvas` `after-change` event            | Batched operations via `beforeChange`/`afterChange` |

## When You Must Call `captureCanvasState()` Manually

The automatic triggers above are designed around LiteGraph's native DOM
rendering. They **do not cover**:

- **Vue-rendered widgets** — Vue handles events internally without triggering
  native DOM events that the tracker listens to (e.g., `mouseup` on a Vue
  dropdown doesn't bubble the same way as a native LiteGraph widget click)
- **Programmatic graph mutations** — Any code that modifies the graph outside
  of user interaction (e.g., applying a template, pasting nodes, aligning)
- **Async operations** — File uploads, API calls that change widget values
  after the initial user gesture

### Pattern for Manual Calls

```typescript
import { useWorkflowStore } from '@/platform/workflow/management/stores/workflowStore'

// After mutating the graph:
useWorkflowStore().activeWorkflow?.changeTracker?.captureCanvasState()
```

### Existing Manual Call Sites

These locations already call `captureCanvasState()` explicitly:

- `WidgetSelectDropdown.vue` — After dropdown selection and file upload
- `ColorPickerButton.vue` — After changing node colors
- `NodeSearchBoxPopover.vue` — After adding a node from search
- `builderViewOptions.ts` — After setting default view
- `useSelectionOperations.ts` — After align, copy, paste, duplicate, group
- `useSelectedNodeActions.ts` — After pin, bypass, collapse
- `useGroupMenuOptions.ts` — After group operations
- `useSubgraphOperations.ts` — After subgraph enter/exit
- `useCanvasRefresh.ts` — After canvas refresh
- `useCoreCommands.ts` — After metadata/subgraph commands
- `workflowService.ts` — After workflow service operations

## Transaction Guards

For operations that make multiple changes that should be a single undo entry:

```typescript
changeTracker.beforeChange()
// ... multiple graph mutations ...
changeTracker.afterChange() // calls captureCanvasState() when nesting count hits 0
```

The `litegraph:canvas` custom event also supports this with `before-change` /
`after-change` sub-types.

## Key Invariants

- `captureCanvasState()` asserts it is called on the active workflow's tracker;
  inactive trackers get an early return (and a DEV error log)
- `captureCanvasState()` is a no-op during `loadGraphData` (guarded by
  `isLoadingGraph`) to prevent cross-workflow corruption
- `captureCanvasState()` is a no-op when `changeCount > 0` (inside a transaction)
- `undoQueue` is capped at 50 entries (`MAX_HISTORY`)
- `graphEqual` ignores node order and `ds` (pan/zoom) when comparing
