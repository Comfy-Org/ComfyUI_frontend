## Development Setup

### Prerequisites & Technology Stack

- **Required Software**:
  - Node.js (v24) and pnpm
  - Git for version control
  - A running ComfyUI backend instance (otherwise, you can use `pnpm dev:cloud`)

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend.git
   cd ComfyUI_frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Configure environment (optional):
   Create a `.env` file in the project root based on the provided [.env_example](.env_example) file.

   **Note about ports**: By default, the dev server expects the ComfyUI backend at `localhost:8188`. If your ComfyUI instance runs on a different port, update this in your `.env` file.

### Dev Server Configuration

To launch ComfyUI and have it connect to your development server:

```bash
python main.py --port 8188
```

If you are on Mac or a low-spec machine, you can run the server in CPU mode

```bash
python main.py --port 8188 --cpu
```

### Dev Server

- Start local ComfyUI backend at `localhost:8188`
- Run `pnpm dev` to start the dev server
- Run `pnpm dev:electron` to start the dev server with electron API mocked
- Run `pnpm dev:cloud` to start the dev server against the cloud backend (instead of local ComfyUI server)

#### Access dev server on touch devices

Enable remote access to the dev server by setting `VITE_REMOTE_DEV` in `.env` to `true`.

After you start the dev server, you should see following logs:

```
> comfyui-frontend@1.3.42 dev
> vite


  VITE v5.4.6  ready in 488 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: http://172.21.80.1:5173/
  ➜  Network: http://192.168.2.20:5173/
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

Make sure your desktop machine and touch device are on the same network. On your touch device,
navigate to `http://<server_ip>:5173` (e.g. `http://192.168.2.20:5173` here), to access the ComfyUI frontend.

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT:
The dev server will NOT load JavaScript extensions from custom nodes. Only core extensions (built into the frontend) will be loaded. This is because the shim system that allows custom node JavaScript to import frontend modules only works in production builds. Python custom nodes still function normally. See [Extension Development Guide](docs/extensions/development.md) for details and workarounds. And See [Extension Overview](docs/extensions/README.md) for extensions overview.


## Development Workflow

### Architecture Decision Records

We document significant architectural decisions using ADRs (Architecture Decision Records). See [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) for all ADRs and the template for creating new ones.

### Backporting Changes to Release Branches

When you fix a bug that affects a version in feature freeze, we use an automated backport process to apply the fix to the release candidate branch.

#### Real Example

- Subgraphs feature was released in v1.24
- While developing v1.25, we discovered a bug in subgraphs
- v1.24 is in feature freeze (only accepting bug fixes, no new features)
- The fix needs to be applied to both main (v1.25) and the v1.24 release candidate

#### How to Backport Your Fix

1. Create your PR fixing the bug on `main` branch as usual
2. Before merging, add these labels to your PR:
   - `needs-backport` - triggers the automated backport workflow
   - `core/1.24` - targets the `core/1.24` release candidate branch
   
3. Merge your PR normally
4. The automated workflow will:
   - Create a new branch from `core/1.24`
   - Apply your changes to that branch
   - Open a new PR to `core/1.24`
   - Comment on your original PR with a link to the backport PR

#### When to Use Backporting

- Bug fixes for features already released
- Security fixes
- Critical issues affecting existing functionality
- Never for new features (these wait for the next release cycle)

#### Handling Conflicts

If the automated cherry-pick fails due to conflicts, the workflow will comment on your PR with:
- The list of conflicting files
- Instructions to manually cherry-pick to the release candidate branch

See [PR #4616](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/pull/4616) for the actual subgraph bugfix that was backported from v1.25 to v1.24.

## Code Editor Configuration

### Recommended Setup

This project includes `.vscode/launch.json.default` and `.vscode/settings.json.default` files with recommended launch and workspace settings for editors that use the `.vscode` directory (e.g., VS Code, Cursor, etc.).

We've also included a list of recommended extensions in `.vscode/extensions.json`. Your editor should detect this file and show a human friendly list in the Extensions panel, linking each entry to its marketplace page.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- `pnpm i` to install all dependencies
- `pnpm test:unit` to execute all unit tests

### Playwright Tests

Playwright tests verify the whole app. See [browser_tests/README.md](browser_tests/README.md) for details. The snapshots are generated in the GH actions runner, not locally.

### Running All Tests

Before submitting a PR, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
pnpm test:unit
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm format
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid `any` types - use proper type definitions
- Never use `@ts-expect-error` - fix the underlying type issue

### Vue 3 Patterns

- Use Composition API for all components
- Follow Vue 3.5+ patterns (props destructuring is reactive)
- Use `<script setup>` syntax

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes instead of custom CSS
- NEVER use `dark:` or `dark-theme:` tailwind variants. Instead use a semantic value from the [style.css](packages/design-system/src/css/style.css) like `bg-node-component-surface`

### Internationalization

- All user-facing strings must use vue-i18n
- Add translations to [src/locales/en/main.json](src/locales/en/main.json)
- Use translation keys: `const { t } = useI18n(); t('key.path')`
- The corresponding values in other locales is generated automatically on releases, PR authors only need to edit [src/locales/en/main.json](src/locales/en/main.json)

## Icons

The project supports three types of icons, all with automatic imports (no manual imports needed):

1. **PrimeIcons** - Built-in PrimeVue icons using CSS classes: `<i class="pi pi-plus" />`
2. **Iconify Icons** - 200,000+ icons from various libraries: `<i class="icon-[lucide--settings]" />`, `<i class="icon-[mdi--folder]" />`
3. **Custom Icons** - Your own SVG icons: `<i-comfy:workflow />`

Icons are powered by the unplugin-icons system, which automatically discovers and imports icons as Vue components. Custom icons are stored in `packages/design-system/src/icons/` and processed by `packages/design-system/src/iconCollection.ts` with automatic validation.

For detailed instructions and code examples, see [packages/design-system/src/icons/README.md](packages/design-system/src/icons/README.md).

## Working with litegraph.js

Since Aug 5, 2025, litegraph.js is now integrated directly into this repository. It was merged using git subtree to preserve the complete commit history ([PR #4667](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/pull/4667), [ADR](docs/adr/0001-merge-litegraph-into-frontend.md)).

### Important Notes

- **Issue References**: Commits from the original litegraph repository may contain issue/PR numbers (e.g., #4667) that refer to issues/PRs in the original litegraph.js repository, not this one.
- **File Paths**: When viewing historical commits, file paths may show the original structure before the subtree merge. In those cases, just consider the paths relative to the new litegraph folder.
- **Contributing**: All litegraph modifications should now be made directly in this repository.

The original litegraph repository (https://github.com/Comfy-Org/litegraph.js) is now archived.

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with main
2. Run all tests and ensure they pass
3. Create a pull request with a clear title and description
4. Use conventional commit format for PR titles:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for test additions/changes
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### Review Process

1. All PRs require at least one review
2. Address review feedback promptly
3. Keep PRs focused - one feature/fix per PR
4. Large features should be discussed in an issue first
