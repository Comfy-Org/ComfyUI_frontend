The i18n collection script generates entries for sidebar tab commands with i18n keys as values (e.g., `"label": "sideToolbar.modelLibrary"`). While this looks incorrect, it works properly because these i18n keys get translated again when displayed in the UI (double translation). We're adding an ignore pattern for the artifact entries in menuLabels while keeping the functional command entries intact.
