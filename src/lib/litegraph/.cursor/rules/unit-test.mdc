# Creating unit tests

- This project uses `vitest` for unit testing
- Tests are stored in the `test/` directory
- Tests should be cross-platform compatible; able to run on Windows, macOS, and linux
  - e.g. the use of `path.resolve`, or `path.join` and `path.sep` to ensure that tests work the same on all platforms
- Tests should be mocked properly
  - Mocks should be cleanly written and easy to understand
  - Mocks should be re-usable where possible

## Unit test style

- Prefer the use of `test.extend` over loose variables
  - To achieve this, import `test as baseTest` from `vitest`
- Never use `it`; `test` should be used in place of this
