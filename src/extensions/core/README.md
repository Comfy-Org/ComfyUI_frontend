## Overview

Extensions in ComfyUI are modular JavaScript modules that extend and enhance the functionality of the frontend. The extensions in this directory are considered "core" as they provide fundamental features that are built into ComfyUI by default.

## Extension Architecture

ComfyUI's extension system follows these key principles:

1. **Registration-based:** Extensions must register themselves with the application using `app.registerExtension()`
2. **Hook-driven:** Extensions interact with the system through predefined hooks
3. **Non-intrusive:** Extensions should avoid directly modifying core objects where possible

## Core Extensions List

The following table lists ALL core extensions in the system as of 2025-01-30:

## Extension Development

When developing or modifying extensions, follow these best practices:

1. **Use provided hooks** rather than directly modifying core application objects
2. **Maintain compatibility** with other extensions
3. **Follow naming conventions** for both extension names and settings
4. **Properly document** extension hooks and functionality
5. **Test with other extensions** to ensure no conflicts

### Extension Registration

Extensions are registered using the `app.registerExtension()` method:

```javascript
app.registerExtension({
  name: "MyExtension",
  
  // Hook implementations
  async init() {
    // Implementation
  },
  
  async beforeRegisterNodeDef(nodeType, nodeData, app) {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  // Other hooks as needed
});
```

## Extension Hooks

ComfyUI extensions can implement various hooks that are called at specific points in the application lifecycle:

### Hook Execution Sequence

#### Web Page Load

```
init
addCustomNodeDefs
getCustomWidgets
beforeRegisterNodeDef    [repeated multiple times]
registerCustomNodes
beforeConfigureGraph
nodeCreated
loadedGraphNode
afterConfigureGraph
setup
```

#### Loading Workflow

```
beforeConfigureGraph
beforeRegisterNodeDef   [zero, one, or multiple times]
nodeCreated             [repeated multiple times]
loadedGraphNode         [repeated multiple times]
afterConfigureGraph
```

#### Adding New Node

```
nodeCreated
```

### Key Hooks

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `init` | Called after canvas creation but before nodes are added |
| `setup` | Called after the application is fully set up and running |
| `addCustomNodeDefs` | Called before nodes are registered with the graph |
| `getCustomWidgets` | Allows extensions to add custom widgets |
| `beforeRegisterNodeDef` | Allows extensions to modify nodes before registration |
| `registerCustomNodes` | Allows extensions to register additional nodes |
| `loadedGraphNode` | Called when a node is reloaded onto the graph |
| `nodeCreated` | Called after a node's constructor |
| `beforeConfigureGraph` | Called before a graph is configured |
| `afterConfigureGraph` | Called after a graph is configured |
| `getSelectionToolboxCommands` | Allows extensions to add commands to the selection toolbox |
